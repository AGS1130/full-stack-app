# Purpose

This serves as a structured guide in how to build your full stack app in case you get lost or don't know how to start.

For now, this will be written in a very high level overview. This should be language agnostic, no deep dives of frameworks or what language will optimize your app. Those decisions should be left to the programmer or team itself.

Anyone with experience in building a full stack app, whether by yourself, with a team, or having individual responsibilities such as the front-end or back-end can contribute to this repo.

## Get data
You need data in some kind of shape or form.

Whatever you are building, be a blog post, quiz app, or the next Airbnb, you're going to need information, facts, or data.

Have a basic understanding of the different __types of data__, and the kinds of questions you can use them to answer.

Two data types many developers should be familiar with are __quantitative and qualitative__.

### Quantitative
Simply, numbers.

* Prices for your e-Commerce site.
* Temperature for your weather app.
* Weight of a user for your weight loss platform.
* Number of tickets avilable for your Ticketmaster clone.

*How will the information change over time?*

### Qualitative
These are words.

Or moreover, responses of an inidivual that have meaning.

In most apps I built, they often come in three forms:

__Binary, Nominal, and Ordinal__

#### Binary
To me, these are assigned as booleans, __True or False__
And their meanings can be best summed as positive or negative.

Or they can be *like or dislike*, *yes or no*, *right or wrong*, etc.
